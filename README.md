Assignment: Rob Soh Ming Yang 


This document explains how I approach a take-home payment assignment from a presales perspective. My focus is to keep the solution torwards the business needs.

1. Start With the Goal and functional requirements 

Before proceed I first clarify:
What the business is trying to do  
What a successful outcome (in this case, customer payment) 

This helps me avoid overbuilding a demo when its required and keeps the solution straightforard.

2. Business needs to Business logic 
I always define a flow and map it accordingly. In the assignment: 
Customer -> Purchase -> Submits Payment -> Return Success / Failure  

This makes it easy for both the business and tech  to follow what is happening.

3. Show only what is required
   
I only set up what is required for the use case:
One-time payments which may include basic success and simple failure handling  
confirmation of payment status  

This keeps the demo realistic enough

4. Build a Working Demo

My priority is to deliver outcomes mapped to requirements:
• One successful payment  
• A visible confirmation step  
• A smooth user experience  

5. Explain simply

I make sure I explain:
What happens at each step and why it is used for
A visual representation at each step aligned to the business outcome 


6. Risks and next step
   
my focus is to ensure customer can have the best understanding and seeing is believing 
A working demo provides this approach. Once this is confirmed, i will present the common risks(if any) and will proceed to the next step with the customer.
